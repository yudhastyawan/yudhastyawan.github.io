Connecting my repositories and the other kinds of stuff on one website
------
There are a lot of things that I have to manage to remember what I am doing currently, so I need the website to handle these issues. I also need to organize my repositories or some tips during my activities in one box.

This is my website for everything that I put in. Thank you if you will look into this simple website for a while.


Feel free to join the collaboration
------
I am always interest with the new thing especially corresponding with my studies: geophysics and seismology, and a lot of interest things those have relationship with the programming: C++, Fortran and python. Therefore, don't hesitate to send me an email to confirm the collaboration that you would like to do.
