Lindu Software
------
We are currently collaborating to create a GUI open-source program based on Python language to work on seismological issues, such as determining and relocating hypocenter, picking the arrival times of seismograms, and tomography. However, the release program is still suspended because of some bugs being needed to be fixed. For resulting the better application, the collaboration could be done by sending an email or commenting on the github repository.

*Note: We have changed the repository to the organization: [Computational Geophysics TG Itera](https://github.com/Computation-Geophysics-TG-Itera)*
